# COS310: Intro to Git - Exercise 2

1 Clone this repository

2 Create a new branch with your name pointing to the same commit as the master branch

3 Modify the src/number_lines script to number lines using letters instead
 e.g. the numbers: 1) echo "hello world"
                   2) echo "bye"

 should become:    a) echo "hello world"
                   b) echo "bye"

4 Commit your changes

5 Merge the newer_master branch into your branch and resolve the conflicts

6 Merge your branch into master

7 Push the repo with your branch to github
